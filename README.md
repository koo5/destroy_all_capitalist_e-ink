so yeah, this work as a sort of cheap vnc on your pocketshit, wifi swindle or whatever other closed source shit out there im gonna fucking kill every person responsible for wasting perfectly usable hardware by crippled software you fuckers.

put it into your webserver directory (/var/www),
mkdir tmp2,
./runloop2.sh

screenshots active window (watch out, for some weird reason scrot (?) keeps bringing it
to the front (wtf?)
diffs with previous screenshot, if it differs, copies it to cam.php, where s.php grabs it
and deletes it. So less unnecessary blinking of your e-ink. Im gonna fucking kill every one of you.
